# kdtree
A super simple KdTree implementation for 3d data points, float x,y,z

To build go to the directory 'app' and run: 'build_win.bat'

Then load 'kdtree.sln' and build a debug version.

Make your working directory be the 'app' folder and run the debug build.

It will load a set of known test data that fails (kdtree.bin) and assert
on the 'findNearest' point case that fails.
